                        <p>Due to the exclusive nature of the Legacy Box Collection and the limited availability, refunds are generally not offered. However, we understand that exceptional circumstances may arise. We handle these situations on a case-by-case basis with the understanding that the value of each box is tied to its exclusivity and the serious commitment of each owner. We encourage potential buyers to thoroughly consider their decision and ask all necessary questions during the consultation process before committing to a purchase.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely! While we want to ensure broad access to this exclusive collection, we do allow serious collectors to acquire multiple boxes if they wish. However, we may implement certain limitations to prevent any single entity from owning too large a portion of the collection, ensuring that the Legacy Boxes remain distributed among a diverse group of visionary collectors. The Founder Box (#1) has special conditions that will be discussed during the consultation process.</p>

                        How does the 30% revenue share work?

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The Founder receives 30% of the revenue from the sale of Boxes #2 through #9. This creates a unique investment opportunity where the Founder benefits from the success of the entire collection. The revenue share is calculated based on the actual sale price of each subsequent box and is distributed quarterly with transparent reporting. This mechanism aligns the Founder's success with the project's overall success, creating a partnership rather than just a purchase.</p>

                        <p>Revenue share payments are distributed quarterly, providing regular returns on your investment. Each quarter, we calculate the total revenue from box sales during that period, allocate the appropriate 30% share to the Founder, and process the payment by the 15th of the month following the end of each quarter. Detailed statements accompany each payment, providing full transparency about how the revenue share was calculated.</p>

                        <p>No, the revenue share applies only to Boxes #2 through #9. The final auction for Box #10 is excluded from the revenue sharing arrangement. This exclusion ensures that the auction can achieve its maximum potential value without being constrained by the revenue sharing structure, while still providing substantial financial benefits to the Founder from the sales of the other seven boxes in the collection.</p>

                        <p>Yes, the Founder Box can be resold, but the revenue sharing agreement would transfer to the new owner.

The unique nature of the Founder Box means that any transfer would need to be carefully handled to preserve the integrity of the agreement and the relationship between the project and the Founder position.</p>
