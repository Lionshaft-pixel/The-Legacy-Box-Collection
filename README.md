# 💎 The Legacy Box Collection

**The Legacy Box Collection** is an experimental art project, luxury collectible, and internet meme all rolled into one.  
Only **10 Legacy Boxes** will ever exist. Each box isn’t about what’s inside, it’s about the story, the exclusivity, and the history you own.

## ⚠️ Overview
- **Founder Box (#1)** → Price: **$10,000**  
  - Grants **30% revenue share** from the fixed price sales of Boxes #2–#9.  
  - Owner is immortalized as the **Founding Investor**.  

- **Standard Boxes (#2–#9)** → Price: **$10,000 each**  
  - 8 total available.  
  - Owners are permanently recognized on the site with chosen alias/name.  

- **Final Box (#10)** → Sold via **auction** to the highest bidder.  
  - Determines the ultimate market value of *nothing*.

## 💰 Revenue Example
- Founder pays **$15k**.  
- If all 8 standard boxes sell: **$80k revenue**.  
- Founder gets **30% share = $24k**.  
- Net gain for Founder: **+ $9k** (plus prestige).  

**Box #10 auction** proceeds are independent and *not* part of the revenue share.
